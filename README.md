# MaisHacks 2022
-----

This is the winning project for McGill's MaisHacks 2022 https://devpost.com/software/project_name?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects

## About the project

Disable students find it really difficult to pace up with the fast moving life of university. Coming from a closely affiliated background of working with disable students from both Concordia University and McGill University, I realised that lecture transcription and note making is a real struggle and not a lot of students come forward to help disable students.

## Solution
We develop a web application; with just one click, it captures the lecture, transcribes it, makes the notes and generates a hand-written PDF of the same. Also, on the website, if a student signup, they have access to community, forum, live chat support. 

Not only this, we also provide a unique lofi music player on the main website itself, as youtube can be a distraction during studies, and this feature also helps in increasing the retention of our website which in turn increases the SEO ranks.

Also, if a student is registered with this app and want to subscribe to our 5 am motivation, that is a really helpful feature for students to remain motivated. Inspired from Robin Sharma's 5am club book, this application sends motivational messages everyday at 5am.

## Special Mention
We ended up winning the second prize ;)
